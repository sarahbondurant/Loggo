# Loggo
Loggo is a simple backlog tracking app. Users can select media that they are actively watching/reading/playing/etc, or intend to in the future. They can find basic information about the media, and share their media progress with other users.

Loggo will be able to show backlogs at a glance and be a tool in helping the user tackle and complete their goals.
